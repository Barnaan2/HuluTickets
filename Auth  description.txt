|    HuluTicket Auth Concepts                     |                         
|-------------------------------------------------|


1.THE USER TABLE: This table will have every user
 and admin information and will have one
 additional column 1.['role']


2.THE CINEMA_ADMIN TABLE: This cinema admin table is
 a pivot table wich will have user_id and Cinema_id
 and it will help us to saparte the cinema which
 each user those who are cinema admins are blongs to.

3.WHO ADDS NEW ADMINS? 

-New admin will be added by the  Super Admin
 who will Be the CEO of HuluTickets. He has
 The power to delete track and review the
 work of each admins.


4.WHO WILL ADD THE USERS?

-In our system users do not just register
 and become a legacy user, rather they wil fill
 and submit form about their cinema,address,
email and others. then our sales group will
 contact them and register them with their 
cinemas which will involve  some business
 agrements too.
 
5.HOW MANY USERS ONE CINEMA COULD HAVE?

-This depends on in our indvidual perspective.
in my view it will be better if They have one 
user for now and in the upcomming versions
